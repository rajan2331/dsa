1.IAM policy for S3 bucket to give specfic permissions
2.DynomoDB table 
3.difference between the SQL and non SQL
4.How to define the dynmodb table what is partion key and index
if we want to query the table when its partion key then we are using the throughout as an ideal manner 
its simple way but when we want to query the other attributes other than the partion key then we need to create the  indexs

5.In realtion to read capacity there is terms accosiated with?  waht is the eventually consistent, strong consistent and the transactional consistent
so if we update atable and then perform a subsequent read on same data then we will get the stale data?this is becasue data will replicate to all the data cebtre and eventually become consistent.this is known as eventually consistent data 
if you want to have the latest data then we need to perform the request we need to mention the attribute known as strong consistency and comes with high cost
if we wnat to have eventuall consistent data then the read throughtput will become double compare to the  strong consistent value 
6.Can also automatically scale the read and write capacity based on the load
7.Can also Encrypt the data
8.Two types of indexes loacl secondary and global secondary
9.Nexxt project Event driven architecture
